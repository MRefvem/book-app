# Book App

**Author**: Michael Refvem
**Author**: Alexander Whan
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Code Fellows Labs 11, 12, 13, 14. We will implement a basic full-stack application for a book list which will include the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database. We will also add the ability to update the details of a book or remove it from the collection.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
06-15-2020 2:15pm - Today's portion of the application involves requesting books from the API. The client can submit a form to search for a book by title or author, and the search results will then be rendered as a list in the browser.

<!-- 01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource. -->

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
